Note that the results are "low" as this DL algorithm tries to predict the type of lung-cancer, and not predict if the patient has lung-cancer. (See Confusion Matrix to understand the results better) 

I'm currently working on an improved fine-tuned model using EfficientNetV2-L architecture. Based on the current results I believe the metrics will exceed the current ones on this repo (Expected Finish: Before the 31st of January)

This computer vision project fascinated me all along. 
From fine-tuning the EfficientNet-based model to modifying class weights to deal with data imbalances in the lung cancer dataset, it was truly fascinating.
