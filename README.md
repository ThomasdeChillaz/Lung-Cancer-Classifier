Note that the results are "low" as this DL algorithm tries to predict the type of lung-cancer, and not predict if the patient has lung-cancer. (See Confusion Matrix to understand the results better) 

This computer vision project fascinated me and took about one month to “perfect”. 
From fine-tuning the EfficientNet-based model to modifying class weights to deal with data imbalances in the lung cancer dataset, it was truly fascinating.
