**NOTE:** Though I've finished the "algorithm aspect" of this project, I am currently working on markdown cells explaining *methodology, hypothesis, and medical context*. There will also be a conclusion on the *clinical implications* and *false positive/negative analysis*, however I would like to present the results to my research mentor beforehand. (Expected Finish: Before the 31st of January)

Note that the results are "low" as this DL algorithm tries to predict the type of lung cancer, and not predict *if* the patient has lung-cancer. (See Confusion Matrix to understand the results better) 

I'm currently working on an improved fine-tuned model using EfficientNetV2-L architecture. Based on the current results I believe the metrics will exceed the current ones on this repo (Expected Finish: Before the 31st of January)

Personal Note: This computer vision project fascinated me all along. 
From fine-tuning the EfficientNet-based model to modifying class weights to deal with data imbalances in the lung cancer dataset, it was truly fascinating.
